## **Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>

The goals of this project
<br>
1. Find a new way of measuring how much water flows in small stream networks using timelapse images captured by inexpensive and off-the-shelf cameras.
2. Provide a web-based platform for making the images, associated climate and other related data as well as the model itself easy to access and explore. 
3. Provide an avenue for Citizen Science engagement with the goal of understanding our water resources better.
<br>
This project will represent a major advancement in how we measure the flow of water by using machine learning (a form of AI) capable of recognizing and reproducing patterns in large and complex datasets such as long-term image timelapses coupled with detailed environmental data. The results of this work will have considerable value for tracking changes in small streams, which are very important habitat for plants and animals. Stream flow is one of the most important environmental drivers in stream habitats, but we donâ€™t currently have a good way to measure stream flow in small stream networks. This is especially important now as small streams are increasingly affected by climate change via more frequent intense floods and more loss of connectivity due to droughts. Additional challenges are introduced by increasing stream temperatures. A better understanding of flow changes and patterns in small streams will help us evaluate which streams are the most likely to be climate refugia and are the best candidates for management and policies to protect vital aquatic habitats otherwise at risk due to warming and drying.

### **Equipment List** <a name="subparagraph1"></a>



<br>
We have attached a list of supplies as a starting point. Actual items will vary depending on the camera and location you choose, as well as the budget you have available. The categories of equipment will likely stay the same. As long as you have a clear view of the river, the images should be useful.

### Trail Cameras <a name="subparagraph2"></a>

<img src="./Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/119876C_1.jpg" width="150" height="150" /><img src="./Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/Bushnell Camo 119875.jpg" width="150" height="150" /><img src="Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/Spypoint 2.jpg" width="250" height="200" /><img src="Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/gaurd pro.jpg" width="150" height="150" />

+ Trail Cameras that support EXFI data embedded images (most game camera images do). The exchangeable image file format (EXIF) is a standard for embedding technical metadata in image files that many camera manufacturers use and many image-processing programs support. EXIF metadata are commonly embedded in TIFF and JPEG images.
+ No resolution requirement. As long as you can see if the stage is high, medium or low, the images are useful.
+ SD card, blue tooth, WIFI and cellualar models available.
+ Price from $99 to $599
  


### SD Cards <a name="subparagraph3"></a>
+ Check camera for compatability (32GB-516GB)


### Batteries <a name="subparagraph4"></a>
+ Camera-specific. (AA batteries - D batteries)

### Security Boxes <a name="subparagraph5"></a>
+ Housing that can be locked that contains the camera.
+ Make sure that they are made to fit the camera you are using.

### Security Box Lock <a name="subparagraph6"></a>
+ Lock to secure camera in the security box.
<img src="Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/Master Lock.jpg" width="150" height="150" />


### Security Cable <a name="subparagraph7"></a> 
+ A cable to prevent theft (lockable). This is not the same as the strap that secures the camera to the tree.

### Camera mounts <a name="subparagraph21"></a>
There are a variety of ways to mount cameras; tree straps, tree screws, Fence T posts and stand alone ground mounts to name a few.

#### Tree Strap.

<p align="left">  
  <img src="Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/Tree strap.jpg" width="150" height="150" />
</p>

+ Strap is provided with the camera for securing the unit to a post or tree.
  - **PROs** 
  - Cheap, they come with camera, generally very stable.
  - Hold position well.
  - Camera harder to notice when strapped to tree.
  - **CONs** 
  - Not adjustable, no ability for adjsuting up or down angle of the camera.
  
  
 
#### Tree screw
<p align="left">
  <img src="Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/Tree Screw.jpg" width="150" height="150" /> 
</p>


+ Tree screw is an additional item that needs to be purchased.
   **PROs** 
  - Many different types.
  - Holds position well.
  - Some versions allow for up and down angle and left to right adjustment.
   **CONs** 
  - If the version is adjustable, care needs to be taken to make sure it is always in the same orientation after maintenace or download.
   
 

#### Fence T post
<p align="left">
  <img src="Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/T post bracket.jpg" width="150" height="150" /> 
</p> 

+ Fence T post and camera mount for T post are additional items that need to be purchased.
  - **PROs** 
  - Allows for camera to be placed where there are no trees.
  - Post can be placed exactly where you want it.
  - Very stable.
  - Holds position well.
 
  - **CONs** 
  - Need to purchase a metal fence T post.
  - Easily noticed, stands out.
  - Hard to install T post in some rocky river banks.
  - If the mount is adjustable, care needs to be taken to make sure it is always in the same orientation after maintenace or download.
  
  #### Ground Mount 
<p align="left">
  <img src="Equipment Info/Flow Cam/Images/Ground Mount.jpg" width="150" height="150" />
</p>

+ Ground Mount an additional item that needs to be purchased. Some come with the camera mount included.
  - **PROs** 
  - Alows for camera to be placed where there are no trees.
  - Easy to install.
  - Hold position well.
  - Very adjustable.
 

  - **CONs** 
  - Easily noticed, stands out.
  - Hard to install in some rocky river banks.
  - Holds position well.
  - Not as stable as a T post setup.
  - If the mount is adjustable, care needs to be taken to make sure it is always in the same orientation after maintenace or download.
 


## **Flow Cam Data collection** <a name="paragraph2"></a>



#### Methods

+ Any size river is useful, although we are mostly targetting headwaters (3rd order and smaller).
+ Establish a location for digital flow collection.
+ Install camera so that you can record clear digital photos of the river in an upstream direction.

*we are currently working on images from diferent angles to see what provides the best data*

</p>


+ Collect digital Photos. Images must have EXIF data embedded (most game camera images do). This becomes an issue if you manipulate the files after download, for example, converting the files to another file type or rotating the images.
+ Flow and image data at any timestep is useful. Data increments ranging from 15-minute to weekly are especially useful (longer than weekly is helpful as it is a long term record of condition.
+ No resolution requirement. As long as you can see if the stage is high, medium or low, the images are useful.
+ Record and check the time zone and daylight savings settings on the game camera at deployment. Most game cameras DO NOT adjust for daylight savings time.
+ Download images and insure that the camera is returned to the same location (angle and line of sight of stream).
+ You can label images as you like.
+ Upload to?
