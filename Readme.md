## **Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>
The goals of this project are to 1) find a new way of measuring how much water flows in small stream networks using timelapse images captured by inexpensive and off-the-shelf cameras and 2) provide a web-based platform for making the images, associated climate and other related data as well as the model itself easy to access and explore. This project will represent a major advancement in how we measure the flow of water by using machine learning (a form of AI) capable of recognizing and reproducing patterns in large and complex datasets such as long-term image timelapses coupled with detailed environmental data. The results of this work will have considerable value for tracking changes in small streams, which are very important habitat for plants and animals. Stream flow is one of the most important environmental drivers in stream habitats, but we donâ€™t currently have a good way to measure stream flow in small stream networks. This is especially important now as small streams are increasingly affected by climate change via more frequent intense floods and more loss of connectivity due to droughts, in addition to challenges introduced by increasing stream temperatures. A better understanding of flow changes and patterns in small streams will help us evaluate which streams are the most likely to be climate refugia and are the best candidates for management and policies to protect vital aquatic habitats otherwise at risk due to warming and drying.

### **Equipment List** <a name="subparagraph1"></a>
*Digital Flow equipment
<br>
We have attached a list of supplies as a starting point, most are theequipment we use. Actulal items will vaty depending on the camera you choose. The catagories will likely stay the same. As long as you haver a clear view of the river the images should be useful.

+ Trail Cameras that support EXFI data embedded images, this is criticle (most game camera images do). This becomes an issue if you manipulate the files after download, for example, converting the files to another file type or rotating the images. The exchangeable image file format (EXIF) is a standard for embedding technical metadata in image files that many camera manufacturers use and many image-processing programs support. EXIF metadata can be embedded in TIFF and JPEG images.
+ No resolution requirement. As long as you can see if the stage is high, medium or low, the images are useful 
+ Sd card, blue tooth, WIFI and cellualar models avaliable.
+ Price from $99 to $599
+ Camera manufacturers
  - **Bushnell** This is the camera manufacturer that we use. There are alot of excellent cameras on the market.
  - Moultrie
  - Stealth Cam
  - Many more


### SD Cards <a name="subparagraph3"></a>
+ Sandisk 32GB


### Batteries <a name="subparagraph4"></a>
+ AA batteries

### Security Boxes <a name="subparagraph5"></a>
+ CAMLOCKBOX

### Security Box Lock <a name="subparagraph6"></a>
+ Masterlock

### Python Cable <a name="subparagraph7"></a>

### Camera mounts <a name="subparagraph21"></a>
There are a variety of way to mount cameras, tree straps, tree screws, Fence T posts and stand alone ground mounts to name a few.

#### Flow Cam Introduction

We are exploring the usefulness of digital photos as a affordable method of assessing stream flow.  In streams where we have generated a accurate stage discharge relationship we can create a digital library of staff gauge height that can be used to accurately calculate flow. Cameras that range from $70 could be a useful method of data collection in contrast to $300 dollar and up level loggers.  Thus allowing form collection of data in more stream locations.

#### Methods

+ Establish a location for discharge data collection as described in Discharge Data Collection SOPs

+ Install camera so that you can record clear digital photos of satff gauge height.

+ Generate a staff discharge rating curve

+ Collect digital Photos
